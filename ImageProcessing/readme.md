_Data for this tutorial is in the attached folder_

Attached we provide files obtained from Sentinel 2, 
which have been mosaiced and clipped to the area of 
interest and converted to multiband GeoTIFF format.

Additionally, the band values have been divided by 4095, to convert from
the range of brightness levels (0-4095) to brightness as a ratio (0-1).

The source data you can find on https://scihub.copernicus.eu/

The multispectral data is in the file **allBands01a.tif**
